- What type/s of regression have you applied?

Multiple linear, polynominal and random forrest regression.

- Which were the challenges?

The biggest challenge was figuring out how to best fit the data to a model, as there are trade offs, like speed and accuracy, depending on how the data is fed to the learning models.

- How accurate is your solution?

The best model had an accuracy of 85%, measured using R2-scoring. For predicting the price of a house, it is not a bad score, but it would need a lot of improvement if it was for predicting medical data.

- What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy?

For just improving the accuracy, more data and perhaps a better evaluation or prioritation of data could improve the accuracy of the used models. Finding a different type of model, which is better suited, could also be a way to increase accuracy.

It would also be a good idea to consider improving the speed of the models.
