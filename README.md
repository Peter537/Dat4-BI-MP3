- What type/s of regression have you applied?

Multiple linear, polynominal and random forrest regression.

- Which were the challenges?

The biggest challenge was figuring out how to best fit the data to a model, as there are trade offs, like speed and accuracy, depending on how the data is fed to the learning models.

- How accurate is your solution?

The best model had an accuracy of 85%, measured using R2-scoring. For predicting the price of a house, it is not a bad score, but it would need a lot of improvement if it was for predicting medical data. That means the model is fine for this usage, but it would require tweaking if it was used for other purposes.

- What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy?

For just improving the accuracy, more data and perhaps a better evaluation or prioritation of data could improve the accuracy of the used models. Finding a different type of model, which is better suited, could also be a way to increase accuracy. Finally, doing more feature engineering might make the model more accurate.

It would also be a good idea to consider improving the speed of the models.
